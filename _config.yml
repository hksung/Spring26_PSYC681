course_name: LING 351 Language Technology and Large Language Models
course_description: This course explores the interaction between language and technology, from the invention of writing systems to modern tools that process and generate language using large language models. While not a technical course in natural language processing (NLP), it may serve as a potential gateway to more implementation-focused studies, as students will learn basic text processing skills in Python. The primary focus is on the linguistic and conceptual understanding underlying language technologies.
