## Use of Generative AI

Students may use generative AI tools as *collaborators*, not as *solution generators*.

- Students may not ask AI tools for direct answers or submit AI-generated work as their own.
- Any use of generative AI must be acknowledged, with a brief paragraph describing how the tool was used. May consult the Student Generative AI Use Scale for guidance: <https://celt.uky.edu/student-ai-use-scale>
- Use of generative AI to substantially complete an assignment constitutes an honor code violation.
